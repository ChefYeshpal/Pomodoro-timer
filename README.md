# Pomodoro-timer
This is just a really simple Pomodoro-timer, nothing special in this other than I made this from the ground up myself (mostly)!!!!
Yeah I had to use co-pilot a little, but it's automatically giving me suggestions and well... it's a little good at them. I'll be doing something to somehow stop those autosuggestions though, it's annoying in my opinion.

And, in case you haven't noticed... I dont know how to write proper README's. My experience is **very** limited...

### Where was AI used?
    1. I mainly used it for javascript, as my knowledge is rather... bad.
    2. It was also used in code review, and for just understading some stuff in CSS, I tried to put a time limit of 2 hours on this project and I really needed it to be done...
    3. No where else really.

The main point of this project was to just test my CSS skills, as it's been some time since I did new things other than just update my own website. Plus, I wanted to try to increase my productivity.
By the way, this is a little inspired from ```pomofocus.io```, I had been using their website since COVID (2019 hm...) and it's pretty good. I also wanted to include some "insights" or some kind of a similar section in my own website, but I guess it's a little hard to do that cause I have absolutely no clue how to store that data in the "cookies" of the browser and all that... Hopefully I learn it soon enough though :D
