# Pomodoro-timer
This is just a really simple Pomodoro-timer, nothing special in this other than I made this from the ground up myself (mostly)!!!!
Yeah I had to use co-pilot a little, but it's automatically giving me suggestions and well... it's a little good at them. I'll be doing something to somehow stop those autosuggestions though, it's annoying in my opinion.

And, in case you haven't noticed... I dont know how to write proper README's. My experience is **very** limited...

### Where was AI used?
    1. I mainly used it for javascript, as my knowledge is rather... bad.
    2. It was also used in code review, and for just understading some stuff in CSS, I tried to put a time limit of 2 hours on this project and I really needed it to be done...
    3. No where else really.

The main point of this project was to just test my CSS skills, as it's been some time since I did new things other than just update my own website. Plus, I wanted to try to increase my productivity.
By the way, this is a little inspired from ```pomofocus.io```, I had been using their website since COVID (2019 hm...) and it's pretty good. I also wanted to include some "insights" or some kind of a similar section in my own website, but I guess it's a little hard to do that cause I have absolutely no clue how to store that data in the "cookies" of the browser and all that... Hopefully I learn it soon enough though :D

## Stuff That works here
    1. Basic timer functionality where it counts down from a user given number to 00:00
    2. Timer working accurately even in the background, processes aren't put in inactive mode (can make countdown inaccurate)
    3. Colour changes based on mode (work or break)
    4. Task's can be created, edited, completed and deleted
    5. Number of pomodoro's shown, 1 pomodoro = worktime + breaktime
    6. Gravity toggle
    7. A clock that shows Union Standard Time

## Stuff I wanted to add
    1. A way to track your progress
        a. Couldn't add this because it would probably require some kind of a storage for the data, I'm really hosting this on my github website so I dont think I'd wanna do it.
    2. Use better colours
        a. The current ones look a little... weird, I'm looking into colour theory for my future projects
    3. Make the gravity toggle better
        a. Currently the stat bar is kind of locked to the central position, it's probably a very easy fix but I've kind of run out of my given time (and I'm lazyyy)
    4. Add an easter egg
        a. I did add some but I dont think it'll be considered one... that's if they're a lazy procastinator like me :p
