# Pomodoro-timer
This is just a really simple Pomodoro-timer, nothing special in this other than I made this from the ground up myself (mostly)!!!!
Yeah I had to use co-pilot a little, but it's automatically giving me suggestions and well... it's a little good at them. I'll be doing something to somehow stop those autosuggestions though, it's annoying in my opinion.

And, in case you haven't noticed... I dont know how to write proper README's. My experience is **very** limited...

### Where was AI used?
    1. I mainly used it for javascript, as my knowledge is rather... bad.
    2. It was also used in code review, and for just understading some stuff in CSS, I tried to put a time limit of 2 hours on this project and I really needed it to be done...
    3. No where else really.

The main point of this project was to just test my CSS skills, as it's been some time since I did new things other than just update my own website. Plus, I wanted to try to increase my productivity.
By the way, this is a little inspired from ```pomofocus.io```, I had been using their website since COVID (2019 hm...) and it's pretty good. I also wanted to include some "insights" or some kind of a similar section in my own website, but I guess it's a little hard to do that cause I have absolutely no clue how to store that data in the "cookies" of the browser and all that... Hopefully I learn it soon enough though :D

## Stuff That works here
- Basic timer functionality where it counts down from a user given number to 00:00
- Timer working accurately even in the background, processes aren't put in inactive mode (can make countdown inaccurate)
- Colour changes based on mode (work or break)
- Task's can be created, edited, completed and deleted
- Number of pomodoro's shown, 1 pomodoro = worktime + breaktime
- Gravity toggle
- A clock that shows Union Standard Time (with a little wonkey thing)

## Stuff I wanted to add
- A way to track your progress
    - Couldn't add this because it would probably require some kind of a storage for the data, I'm really hosting this on my github website so I dont think I'd wanna do it.
- Use better colours
    - The current ones look a little... weird, I'm looking into colour theory for my future projects
- Make the gravity toggle better
    - Currently the stat bar is kind of locked to the central position, it's probably a very easy fix but I've kind of run out of my given time (and I'm lazyyy)
- Add an easter egg
    - I did add some but I dont think it'll be considered one... that's if they're a lazy procastinator like me :p

## Updates
- 18 September 2025
    - Added a progress bar in the top
    - Made it so that pressing enter on keyboard also saves your config in the edit session window, before you had to move the mouse *all* the way over to the "save" button and click.
    - Added feature of sending notification after the timer ends, with subtitles.
