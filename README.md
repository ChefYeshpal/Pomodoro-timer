# Pomodoro-timer
This is just a really simple Pomodoro-timer, nothing special in this other than I made this from the ground up myself!!!!
Yeah I had to use co-pilot a little, but it's automatically giving me suggestions and well... it's a little good at them. I'll be doing something to somehow stop those autosuggestions though, it's annoying in my opinion.

And, in case you haven't noticed... I dont know how to write proper README's. My experience is **very** limited...
